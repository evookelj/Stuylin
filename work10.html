<p>Whoa, this guy's straight? It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<p>I'm half machine. I'm a monster. That's why you always leave a note! I care deeply for nature. I hear the jury's still out on science. I've opened a door here that I regret. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</p>

<p>Whoa, this guy's straight? Really? Did nothing cancel? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Guy's a pro. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? No… but I'd like to be asked!</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Well, what do you expect, mother? Steve Holt! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</p>
<p>There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I've opened a door here that I regret. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>

<p>Marry me. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
